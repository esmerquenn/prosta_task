    <h4 id="about-section">About</h4>
    <div class="p">
      <p>
        I am a passionate web developer with a strong foundation in HTML, CSS,
        JavaScript, and backend technologies. I love creating dynamic and
        interactive <span>web applications</span> that solve real-world problems. With years
        of experience in building websites and web applications, I strive to
        improve user experience and make every web solution seamless and user-friendly.
      </p>
      <p>
        Over the years, I have worked with multiple programming languages such
        as Python and PHP, using them <span>to develop server-side</span> functionality and
        interact with databases. I have also gained valuable knowledge in
        modern front-end frameworks such as React.js, which enables me to build
        responsive, fast, and scalable web apps. My goal is to create
        performance-optimized web applications that deliver great results and
        meet the needs of users across all devices.
      </p>
      <p>
        Outside of my professional work, I enjoy learning about new technologies
        and continuously improving my skills through courses and personal projects.
        I am constantly exploring the latest <span>web development trends</span> and keeping up
        with best practices in the industry. Whether it's building a portfolio website
        or contributing to open-source projects, I am always eager to work on new
        challenges and contribute to the tech community.
